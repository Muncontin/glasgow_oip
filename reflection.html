          <h3>Stakeholder</h3>
          <div class="reflection-section">
            <p>
              With the final solutions completed, we are glad that the 3 week
              journey is finally over. The various interactions between team
              members, stakeholders and our peers who helped us to test our
              solutions helped us to grow as a team and improve our designs over
              the duration of the module. Firstly, with Chrissy, our partner,
              and Elspeth, our tour guide of the day at the Botanical Gardens,
              they helped us to shape the initial solutions as well as
              understand the different constraints that the team had to work
              around.
            </p>

            <p>
              Chrissy's answers to our questions during the Q&A session showed
              that since most volunteers were not technologically competent and
              were not trained to support the needs of visually or audibly
              impaired visitors, the Botanic Gardens had limited resources to
              implement significant changes. This insight helped us to reshape
              our initial solutions to focus on ideas that did not require any
              training or extensive technical support so that they could be
              easily adopted by the existing volunteers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, she also revealed that the gardens were reliant on a
              public funding and volunteer model, which forced us to respect
              tight budgets and limited technical support. This meant that any
              solution we proposed needed to be low-cost and realistic for
              implementation, pushing us to think more critically and creatively
              within those boundaries. This understanding led us to move away
              from complex infrastructural ideas and instead focus on adaptable,
              low-cost solutions like braille-enhanced signage with QR Code that
              directs to an enhanced website with BSL Translations.
              Additionally, this meant that during our evaluation of our early
              idea: implementing a braille pathway. While initially promising,
              we found this to be impractical due to the narrow pathways within
              the garden, the high costs associated with such an infrastructure
              change, and the potential negative impact on the soil quality,
              which could affect the health of the plants. This forced us to
              reconsider our assumptions and pivot toward more feasible,
              non-invasive alternatives. Chrissy also revealed that there is
              currently no support for the visually and audibly impaired
              visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elspeth’s replies to our impromptu interview revealed that only
              optional training was provided to volunteers to support the needs
              of visually impaired visitors. She also shared that sometimes for
              visually impaired visitors, they are guided through more tactile
              experiences, such as being allowed to touch plants and sculptures
              under supervision. As Elspeth was a partially blind person
              herself, we were able to develop our ideas into the final
              prototypes with her suggestions on how to improve the tactile
              experience for visually impaired visitors and enrich their
              experience of the gardens as much as possible. This experience
              inspired us to enhance our prototype and come up with the idea of
              our Braille Guidebook. These real-world insights helped us refine
              our direction and iterate our ideas with user experience at the
              core.
            </p>

            <p>
              The guided tour conducted by Elspeth also allowed us to observe
              the garden's layout and signage firsthand and to experience how
              information is typically presented to visitors. We discovered that
              the guided tour provided significantly more context and depth than
              the available signage, highlighting the importance of interactive,
              human-led experiences in a setting like the Botanic Gardens.

              <li>
                Chrissy revealed that most volunteers aren’t trained or
                tech-savvy, so we focused on solutions that don’t require
                digital tools or special training.
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to public funding and limited resources, we had to design
                low-cost, non-invasive solutions which ruled out ideas like a
                braille pathway.
              </li>
              <li>
                We pivoted to ideas like braille-enhanced signage with QR codes

              <li>
                Elspeth, who is partially blind, shared how tactile guidance
                (e.g. touching plants/statues) helps blind visitors which
                inspired our Braille Guidebook.
              </li>
              <li>
                Observing a live tour highlighted how much more informative it

          <div class="reflection-section">
            <p>
              Next during the prototyping journey, the team realized that
              accessibility is often overlooked in design and we made sure to do
              our best to improve our designs based on what the users might
              need. Through empathy mapping and informal interviews, we
              redesigned our prototype based on feedback from users, peers and
              even our Teaching Assistants to see if our prototype was intuitive
              and easy to use for our users. We experimented with various
              methods such as the TalkBack on Android to emulate how the
              visually impaired would navigate our website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Testing these prototypes was both enlightening and humbling, where
              it showed us that even when our team was developing solutions for
              the target users in mind, there were still many things that we
              overlooked like button designs or layouts of the braille guidebook
              that we were unable to notice unless we were placed in similar
              situations as the users by using blindfolds. And even then because
              we were the ones working on the solutions, there were many
              assumptions that we had that were actual issues such as the BSL
              translation button not being clear about what purpose it serves
              according to several users.
            </p>

            <p>
              All these lead to a redesign and overhaul of some of our
              prototypes with the feedback in mind leading to the current
              solutions proposed. In the end, our prototype phases didn’t just
              validate ideas, they reshaped them, reminding us that genuine
              inclusivity lies in observing, listening, and relentlessly
              refining until solutions become seamless extensions of the user’s
              experience.

              <li>
                The team became aware of how easily accessibility is neglected

              <li>
                We used empathy mapping, informal interviews, and feedback from

              </li>
              <li>
                Using tools like Android’s TalkBack and blindfolds gave us
                insight into user experiences, but also highlighted that
                simulations have limits.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite designing with users in mind, we discovered overlooked

                issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                We learned that being the designers introduced bias and

              <li>
                Iterative feedback and testing reshaped our designs

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <div class="reflection-section">
            <p>
              Conducting usability tests on our proposed accessibility solutions
              revealed significant room for improvement. We carried out two
              separate tests, each targeting a specific user group. The first
              focused on how effectively deaf users could navigate from physical
              signage to a website hosting a British Sign Language (BSL) video.
              To simulate the experience of someone who prefers sign language
              over written English, we intentionally translated the webpage into
              a foreign language unfamiliar to all participants. This allowed us
              to observe whether they could intuitively locate and play the BSL
              video without relying on written instructions.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second test assessed the accessibility of our tactile
              guidebook design. Lacking both access to blind participants and a
              physical prototype, we created a digital version compatible with
              screen readers like TalkBack on Android. Participants navigated
              the guidebook using these tools while keeping their eyes closed,
              voicing any challenges or positive impressions they experienced.
            </p>

            <p>
              Designing the guidebook test forced us to think creatively. We had
              to simulate the experience of a blind user without fully
              understanding the nuances of visual impairment or braille, despite
              our prototype relying heavily on tactile and braille-based
              features. Using screen readers helped bridge the gap caused by the
              lack of a physical prototype, but we acknowledge that this
              approach is ultimately a compromise. The depth and accuracy of
              insights gained cannot replace feedback from actual visually
              impaired users.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nonetheless, both tests generated valuable findings. Despite our
              intention to design accessible solutions, users encountered
              notable friction. The BSL video button, for instance, was not
              easily recognisable, even to tech-savvy participants. In the
              guidebook test, users frequently mistook the instructional text
              for the actual QR code and struggled to identify its location.
              This highlighted the importance of spatial clarity and tactile
              guidance in the physical layout. These issues made us realise that
              even small design elements can create significant barriers if not
              approached from the user’s perspective. It challenged our
              assumptions about what we thought was intuitive and reminded us
              that accessibility isn’t just about adding features but it’s also
              about ensuring those features are truly usable by the people
              they’re meant to help.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ultimately, the execution and designing of the usability testing
              deepened our understanding of accessibility challenges. It
              revealed assumptions we had made unconsciously, and pushed us to
              prioritize real-world usability over theoretical design. These
              findings are crucial in refining our solutions to better meet the
              needs of those with visual and auditory impairments.

              <li>
                Testing revealed that well-intentioned accessibility features
                can still create barriers if not designed from the user's
                perspective.
              </li>
              <li>
                We learned that assumptions about what is “intuitive” often
                don’t hold true for diverse users, especially those with sensory
                impairments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simulating accessibility needs by using screen readers or
                foreign languages helped bridge gaps, but we realised this is
                not a substitute for real user feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                The difficulty users had with small design elements like button
                recognition or QR code placement taught us how clarity and
                simplicity are in accessible design.
              </li>
              <li>
                The lack of access to blind testers pushed us to think
                creatively by finding alternative ways to test a tactile design
                in a non-tactile format, leading us to explore digital screen
                readers as a workaround
              </li>
              <li>
                We gained a deeper appreciation that accessibility isn’t just
                about feature inclusion, but about usability and real-world
                effectiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                The process made us reflect on the importance of iterative
                testing and involving users with lived experience to avoid
                designing based on assumptions.

      <h2>Reflection Essay: Glasgow Botanic Gardens Accessibility Project</h2>
      <div class="essay-section">
        <div class="essay-content">
          <p>
            Throughout the Glasgow Botanic Gardens accessibility project, we
            were driven by a strong sense of empathy and purpose. Our process
            was grounded in direct engagement, observational research, and
            collaborative dialogue, which allowed us to develop
            context-sensitive solutions that aimed to be inclusive, feasible,
            and impactful.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the values that shaped our work was
            <strong>empathetic research</strong>. By attending guided tours and
            speaking with stakeholders like Chrissy and Elspeth, we ensured that
            our design decisions were not speculative but informed by lived
            experiences. This grounding helped us move beyond assumptions and
            toward solutions that responded to real-world challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stakeholder collaboration</strong> was a cornerstone of our
            approach. Chrissy and Elspeth’s openness gave us deep insights into
            the Garden’s operations and constraints. Rather than treating them
            as passive informants, we embraced them as co-designers, allowing
            their perspectives to actively shape the direction of our design
            thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            When our initial idea: a braille pathway has proved to be
            impractical due to spatial and ecological constraints, we
            demonstrated our <strong>willingness to pivot</strong>. Instead of
            viewing this as a failure, we saw it as a growth opportunity. We
            collectively shifted towards a more viable solution: QR-coded
            signage and a braille-enhanced guidebook. This flexibility
            reinforced the importance of staying adaptable and context-aware.
          </p>

          <p>
            Facing <strong>real-world constraints</strong> such as limited
            funding and infrastructure, we took these as creative prompts rather
            than restrictions. Chrissy’s guidance helped us shape low-cost,
            sustainable interventions that aligned with the Garden’s capacities.
            We learned that impactful, inclusive design does not always require
            major infrastructure.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also took a <strong>universal design</strong> approach, ensuring
            that our solutions didn’t just serve visually or audibly impaired
            individuals but also supported elderly visitors, non-native
            speakers, and people with cognitive differences. This broadened our
            sense of accessibility to one of inclusive usability for all.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Our team dynamics</strong> were another source of pride.
            Early role definition allowed us to manage tasks efficiently while
            respecting each member’s working style. We created an open,
            reflective team culture that allowed us to challenge ideas
            constructively and support one another through uncertainty. Moments
            like post-meeting debriefs with Chrissy helped us reassess and
            co-develop better-aligned ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’re proud that everyone contributed to ideation, research, and
            fieldwork, resulting in a more thoughtful, well-rounded solution.
            Through this experience, it wasn’t just our prototype that matured
            but our own capacity for reflection, empathy, and collaboration.
          </p>

            That said, the project surfaced several
            <strong>areas for improvement</strong>. While our digital prototypes
            were useful for iteration and presentation, we believe that
            developing physical versions of certain ideas such as the braille
            signboard or the tactile guidebook could have added significant
            value. Tangible prototypes would have allowed stakeholders,
            especially those unfamiliar with accessibility tools, to better
            grasp the practicality and impact of our solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also recognise a key limitation in our process: the
            <strong>lack of direct engagement with end users</strong>. Although
            we consulted with stakeholders, we were unable to involve visually
            or audibly impaired individuals firsthand. This highlighted the
            critical importance of co-creation and continuous feedback loops
            which we would like to prioritise in future iterations. Direct input
            from those with lived experience would have significantly deepened
            our understanding of their specific needs and enhanced the relevance
            of our solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we identified the need for
            <strong>more structured documentation</strong>. While we gathered
            valuable insights through interviews and site visits, we lacked a
            shared system to consolidate and refer back to our findings.
            Introducing design logs, decision journals, or audit checklists
            could improve our process going forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Looking ahead</strong>, we strongly advocate for deeper
            integration of co-design principles. Designing alongside blind and
            deaf individuals through interviews, workshops, and prototype
            walkthroughs would help surface needs and insights we may have
            otherwise missed. In a nutshell, this project taught us that
            external observation is only part of the picture; designing for
            accessibility demands that lived experience is placed at the heart
            of the process.
