          <h3>Glasgow Botanic Gardens Partnership</h3>
          <div class="reflection-section">
            <h4>What Worked Well</h4>
            <p>
              Throughout the project, we collaborated with our assigned partner,
              Chrissy, and attended a guided tour conducted by Elspeth. Both
              were incredibly warm, welcoming, and supportive of our initiative
              to enhance accessibility for visually and audibly impaired
              visitors. Their openness made communication smooth and fostered a
              collaborative atmosphere from the beginning.
            </p>

            <p>
              The guided tour with Elspeth was particularly valuable. It allowed
              us to observe the garden's layout and signage firsthand and to
              experience how information is typically presented to visitors. We
              discovered that the guided tour provided significantly more
              context and depth than the available signage, highlighting the
              importance of interactive, human-led experiences in a setting like
              the Botanic Gardens.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, our informal discussion with Elspeth after the tour
              gave us unique insights into how visually impaired visitors are
              sometimes guided through more tactile experiences, such as being
              allowed to touch plants and sculptures under supervision. These
              authentic interactions helped us better understand the user
              experience and the garden's current limitations. Furthermore, with
              Elspeth's input as someone who was partially blind herself, we were able to 
              develop our ideas into the final prototypes with her suggestions on
              how to improve the tactile experience for visually impaired
              visitors.
            </p>

            <h4>Challenges and Learning Opportunities</h4>
            <p>
              One of the primary challenges we encountered was the constraint of
              limited funding. Through conversations with Chrissy, she revealed that
              the gardens were reliant on a public funding and volunteer model, which 
              forced us to respect tight budgets and limited technical support.
              This meant that any solution we proposed needed to be low-cost and
              realistic for implementation, pushing us to think more critically
              and creatively within those boundaries.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another learning point came during our evaluation of our early
              idea: implementing a braille pathway. While initially promising,
              we found this to be impractical due to the narrow pathways within
              the garden, the high costs associated with such an infrastructure
              change, and the potential negative impact on the soil quality,
              which could affect the health of the plants. This forced us to
              reconsider our assumptions and pivot toward more feasible,
              non-invasive alternatives.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also came to realize that there is currently minimal formal
              support for blind and deaf visitors. There is currently no braille
              signage, no audio description system, and only optional training
              were provided to volunteers to support the needs of visually
              impaired visitors. While this revealed a gap in accessibility, it
              also clarified the opportunity and necessity for targeted,
              cost-effective interventions.
            </p>

            <h4>Impact on Solution Development</h4>
            <p>
              Our interaction with the partners had a direct and meaningful
              impact on the development of our solution. The initial meeting
              with Chrissy helped set realistic expectations about the budget
              and current state of accessibility within the gardens, guiding us
              to explore simpler, scalable interventions. This understanding led
              us to move away from complex infrastructural ideas and instead
              focus on adaptable, low-cost solutions like braille-enhanced
              signage with QR Code that directs to an enhanced website with BSL
              Translations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, Chrissy's answers to our questions during the Q&A session
              showed that since most volunteers were not technologically competent and
              were not trained to support the needs of visually or audibly impaired
              visitors, the Botanic Gardens had limited resources to implement
              significant changes. This insight helped us to reshape our initial
              solutions to focus on ideas that did not require any training or
              extensive technical support so that they could be easily adopted by
              the existing volunteers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, observing the guided tour and learning about the
              informal tactile experiences such as getting the visitors to touch 
              the veins and the sample plants provided to visually impaired
              visitors inspired us to enhance our prototype and come up with the
              idea of our Braille Guidebook. These real-world insights helped us
              refine our direction and iterate our ideas with user experience at
              the core.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, the partnership helped us root our project in the actual
              needs and limitations of the space, ensuring that our solution was
              not only innovative but also practical, inclusive, and
              implementable.

      <h2>What We Are Proud Of</h2>
      <div class="essay-content">
        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>Grounded, Empathetic Research</h3>
          <p>
            We’re proud of how we took the time to truly understand the
            environment we were designing for. By attending guided tours,
            observing accessibility issues firsthand, and engaging with both
            Chrissy and Elspeth, we made sure our ideas were based on real
            experiences, not assumptions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>Effective Stakeholder Collaborations</h3>
          <p>
            We had meaningful interactions with our partners Chrissy and
            Elspeth, who generously shared their insights with us. Their support
            and feedback were instrumental in helping us shape a solution that
            fits the Botanic Gardens' context.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>Willingness to Pivot and Adapt</h3>
          <p>
            When we realised that our original idea of the braille pathway
            wasn’t practical due to space and budget constraints, we didn’t
            hesitate to rethink our approach. We adapted quickly and refocused
            our efforts on ideas that were both impactful and feasible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>Designing Within Real Constraints</h3>
          <p>
            We embraced the challenge of designing within the real-world
            limitations of the garden, such as limited funding and
            infrastructure. This pushed us to be more creative and come up with
            solutions that are low-cost, implementable, and sustainable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>Prioritising Inclusive Impact</h3>
          <p>
            We’re proud that our solution doesn’t just benefit people with
            visual or auditory impairments but it’s designed with everyone in
            mind. By taking a universal design approach, we aimed to improve the
            visitor experience for elderly guests, non-native speakers, and
            anyone who might need extra support navigating the space.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>Collaborative Team Dynamics</h3>
          <p>
            One of the things we’re most proud of is how well we worked together
            as a team. From the very beginning, we clearly defined our roles and
            responsibilities, which helped ensure that tasks were managed
            efficiently and communication remained open. Despite having
            different working styles and ideas, we created a space where
            everyone felt heard and respected, and this made a big difference in
            how we approached problem-solving.
          </p>

          <p>
            During key phases like the stakeholder meetings, guided tours, and
            prototype development, we collaborated closely to document findings,
            share insights, and bounce ideas off each other. For example, after
            our meeting with Chrissy, we had an in-depth team discussion to
            reassess the feasibility of our original idea, the braille pathway
            and together we agreed to pivot toward more achievable solutions.
            This collective decision-making process showed us how valuable it is
            to stay flexible and support one another through uncertainty.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also made sure that everyone contributed to the design
            iterations, research, and field observations, which gave us a more
            well-rounded understanding of the problem and helped shape a more
            inclusive and thoughtful solution. The diversity of perspectives
            within our team ultimately strengthened the outcome of our work.

          <h3>Making Prototyping More Tangible</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, all of our prototypes were kept in digital
            format. While this was efficient for iteration and presentation, we
            believe that developing physical versions of certain ideas such as
            the braille signboard or the tactile guidebook could have added
            significant value. Tangible prototypes would have allowed
            stakeholders, especially those unfamiliar with accessibility tools,
            to better grasp the practicality and impact of our solutions.

          <h3>Limited Engagement with End Users</h3>
          <p>
            Due to the short timeframe of the project, we were unfortunately
            unable to directly engage with visually or audibly impaired
            individuals. While we gained valuable insights through our
            interactions with stakeholders and guided tours, we recognise that
            including direct input from affected users would have further
            strengthened our understanding of their specific needs. This
            limitation highlighted the importance of co-design and inclusive
            consultation, which we would prioritise more fully in a longer-term
            or future project.

        <div class="essay-section">
          <h3>More Structured Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Our team collected a lot of valuable insights from the tour,
            interviews, and observations, but we could have improved the way we
            organised and recorded this information. A more structured
            documentation process, such as a shared insights log or
            accessibility audit checklist would have made it easier to refer
            back to key findings when developing and justifying our solution.

            Moving forward, we recommend involving blind and deaf individuals
            directly in the design process through co-creation workshops,
            interviews, or usability testing. Their lived experiences are
            essential for validating assumptions and ensuring that solutions
            truly meet their needs. While time constraints limited this during
            our project, it should be a priority in future iterations.
