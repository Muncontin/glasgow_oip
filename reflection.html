        <h3>Glasgow Botanic Gardens Partnership</h3>
        <div class="reflection-section">
          <h4>What Worked Well</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, we collaborated with our assigned partner,
            Chrissy, and attended a guided tour conducted by Elspeth. Both
            were incredibly warm, welcoming, and supportive of our initiative
            to enhance accessibility for visually and audibly impaired
            visitors. Their openness made communication smooth and fostered a
            collaborative atmosphere from the beginning.
          </p>

          <p>
            The guided tour with Elspeth was particularly valuable. It allowed
            us to observe the garden's layout and signage firsthand and to
            experience how information is typically presented to visitors. We
            discovered that the guided tour provided significantly more
            context and depth than the available signage, highlighting the
            importance of interactive, human-led experiences in a setting like
            the Botanic Gardens.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, our informal discussion with Elspeth after the tour
            gave us unique insights into how visually impaired visitors are
            sometimes guided through more tactile experiences, such as being
            allowed to touch plants and sculptures under supervision. These
            authentic interactions helped us better understand the user
            experience and the garden's current limitations. Furthermore, with
            Elspeth's input as someone who was partially blind herself, we were able to
            develop our ideas into the final prototypes with her suggestions on
            how to improve the tactile experience for visually impaired
            visitors.
          </p>

          <h4>Challenges and Learning Opportunities</h4>
          <p>
            One of the primary challenges we encountered was the constraint of
            limited funding. Through conversations with Chrissy, she revealed that
            the gardens were reliant on a public funding and volunteer model, which
            forced us to respect tight budgets and limited technical support.
            This meant that any solution we proposed needed to be low-cost and
            realistic for implementation, pushing us to think more critically
            and creatively within those boundaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another learning point came during our evaluation of our early
            idea: implementing a braille pathway. While initially promising,
            we found this to be impractical due to the narrow pathways within
            the garden, the high costs associated with such an infrastructure
            change, and the potential negative impact on the soil quality,
            which could affect the health of the plants. This forced us to
            reconsider our assumptions and pivot toward more feasible,
            non-invasive alternatives.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also came to realize that there is currently minimal formal
            support for blind and deaf visitors. There is currently no braille
            signage, no audio description system, and only optional training
            were provided to volunteers to support the needs of visually
            impaired visitors. While this revealed a gap in accessibility, it
            also clarified the opportunity and necessity for targeted,
            cost-effective interventions.
          </p>

          <h4>Impact on Solution Development</h4>
          <p>
            Our interaction with the partners had a direct and meaningful
            impact on the development of our solution. The initial meeting
            with Chrissy helped set realistic expectations about the budget
            and current state of accessibility within the gardens, guiding us
            to explore simpler, scalable interventions. This understanding led
            us to move away from complex infrastructural ideas and instead
            focus on adaptable, low-cost solutions like braille-enhanced
            signage with QR Code that directs to an enhanced website with BSL
            Translations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, Chrissy's answers to our questions during the Q&A session
            showed that since most volunteers were not technologically competent and
            were not trained to support the needs of visually or audibly impaired
            visitors, the Botanic Gardens had limited resources to implement
            significant changes. This insight helped us to reshape our initial
            solutions to focus on ideas that did not require any training or
            extensive technical support so that they could be easily adopted by
            the existing volunteers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, observing the guided tour and learning about the
            informal tactile experiences such as getting the visitors to touch
            the veins and the sample plants provided to visually impaired
            visitors inspired us to enhance our prototype and come up with the
            idea of our Braille Guidebook. These real-world insights helped us
            refine our direction and iterate our ideas with user experience at
            the core.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, the partnership helped us root our project in the actual
            needs and limitations of the space, ensuring that our solution was
            not only innovative but also practical, inclusive, and
            implementable.

    <h2>Reflection Essay: Glasgow Botanic Gardens Accessibility Project</h2>
    <div class="essay-section">
      <div class="essay-content">
        <p>
          Throughout the Glasgow Botanic Gardens accessibility project, we were driven by a strong sense of empathy and
          purpose.
          Our process was grounded in direct engagement, observational research, and collaborative dialogue, which
          allowed us to
          develop context-sensitive solutions that aimed to be inclusive, feasible, and impactful.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the values that shaped our work was <strong>empathetic research</strong>. By attending guided tours and
          speaking
          with stakeholders like Chrissy and Elspeth, we ensured that our design decisions were not speculative but
          informed by
          lived experiences. This grounding helped us move beyond assumptions and toward solutions that responded to
          real-world
          challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Stakeholder collaboration</strong> was a cornerstone of our approach. Chrissy and Elspeth’s openness
          gave us deep
          insights into the Garden’s operations and constraints. Rather than treating them as passive informants, we
          embraced
          them as co-designers, allowing their perspectives to actively shape the direction of our design thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          When our initial idea: a braille pathway has proved to be impractical due to spatial and ecological
          constraints, we demonstrated
          our <strong>willingness to pivot</strong>. Instead of viewing this as a failure, we saw it as a growth
          opportunity. We
          collectively shifted towards a more viable solution: QR-coded signage and a braille-enhanced guidebook. This
          flexibility
          reinforced the importance of staying adaptable and context-aware.
        </p>

        <p>
          Facing <strong>real-world constraints</strong> such as limited funding and infrastructure, we took these as
          creative
          prompts rather than restrictions. Chrissy’s guidance helped us shape low-cost, sustainable interventions that
          aligned
          with the Garden’s capacities. We learned that impactful, inclusive design does not always require major
          infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also took a <strong>universal design</strong> approach, ensuring that our solutions didn’t just serve
          visually or
          audibly impaired individuals but also supported elderly visitors, non-native speakers, and people with
          cognitive
          differences. This broadened our sense of accessibility to one of inclusive usability for all.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Our team dynamics</strong> were another source of pride. Early role definition allowed us to manage
          tasks
          efficiently while respecting each member’s working style. We created an open, reflective team culture that
          allowed us
          to challenge ideas constructively and support one another through uncertainty. Moments like post-meeting
          debriefs with
          Chrissy helped us reassess and co-develop better-aligned ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re proud that everyone contributed to ideation, research, and fieldwork, resulting in a more thoughtful,
          well-rounded solution. Through this experience, it wasn’t just our prototype that matured but our own capacity
          for reflection, empathy, and collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, the project surfaced several <strong>areas for improvement</strong>. While our digital prototypes
          were useful for iteration and presentation, we believe that developing physical
          versions of certain ideas such as the braille signboard or the tactile guidebook could have added significant
          value. Tangible prototypes would have allowed stakeholders, especially those unfamiliar with accessibility
          tools, to better grasp the practicality and impact of our solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also recognise a key limitation in our process: the <strong>lack of direct engagement with end
            users</strong>. Although we consulted with stakeholders, we were unable to involve visually or audibly
          impaired individuals firsthand. This highlighted the critical importance of co-creation and continuous
          feedback loops - elements we would prioritise in future iterations. Direct input from those with lived
          experience would have significantly deepened our understanding of their specific needs and enhanced the
          relevance of our solutions.
        </p>


        <p>
          Finally, we identified the need for <strong>more structured documentation</strong>. While we gathered valuable
          insights
          through interviews and site visits, we lacked a shared system to consolidate and refer back to our findings.
          Introducing
          design logs, decision journals, or audit checklists could improve our process going forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Looking ahead</strong>, we strongly advocate for deeper integration of co-design principles. Designing
          alongside blind and deaf individuals through interviews, workshops, and prototype walkthroughs would help
          surface needs
          and insights we may have otherwise missed. In a nutshell, this project taught us that external observation is
          only
          part of the picture; designing for accessibility demands that lived experience is placed at the heart of the
          process.
