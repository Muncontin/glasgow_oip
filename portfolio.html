          <h3>Interview with Elspeth</h3>
          <p>
            In our brief discussion with Elspeth, a volunteer who is partially
            blind herself, we gained insight into how the tour is adapted for
            visitors with visual impairments. Volunteers are trained to guide
            blind participants using techniques such as offering their elbow for
            support and encouraging tactile exploration. While the tours have
            not yet catered specifically to deaf participants, a typical group
            for those with impairments would maintain a 1:5
            volunteer-to-participant ratio, with a preference for
            English-speaking attendees. During the tours, participants are
            encouraged to touch certain plants and even statues to enhance
            sensory engagement, though precautions are taken with plants that
            may be harmful, such as cacti or the Venus flytrap. Elspeth also
            mentioned that there are around 20 volunteers involved in
            facilitating these tours.

          <h3>Q&A with Chrissy</h3>
          <p>
            During a Question and Answer session with Chrissy, a volunteer at the Botanic Gardens,
            we explored the current accessibility features and challenges faced
            by visitors with visual and hearing impairments. Chrissy highlighted
            that there were no support for the visually and audibly impaired at the
            gardens. Chrissy also expressed that the Friends of the Botanics are
            willing to explore potential solutions to enhance accessibility but the cost
            should be kept to a minimum.
