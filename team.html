        <h2>Our Collaborative Methodology</h2>
        <div class="approach-content">
            <div class="methodology-intro">
                <p>Our team employed a human-centered design methodology that incorporated stakeholder collaboration, iterative development cycles, and contextual research. Thus, this approach guided the ideation, testing, and refinement of solutions to ensure accessibility with long-term viability.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="methodology-grid">

                    <div class="methodology-icon">ðŸ’¡</div>
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p>We began with collaborative brainstorming sessions that combined accessibility needs with creative ideation, allowing the team to generate and refine a broad range of concepts through sketching, feedback loops, and feasibility mapping.</p>
                    <ul class="methodology-details">
                        <li>Rapid ideation and sketching</li>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>Low-fidelity prototypes were created to test ideas early and often. These were continuously improved based on field observations and stakeholder feedback.</p>
                    <ul class="methodology-details">
                        <li>Low-fidelity prototype creations</li>

                    <h3>Solution Alignment</h3>
                    <p>Our final concepts were aligned with real-world constraints including cost, maintenance, and durability. This ensured that our proposed solutions were not only user-friendly, but also feasible and sustainable long-term.</p>
